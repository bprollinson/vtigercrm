vtigerCRM Readme
----------------

After several months of working on our CRM solution, based on Apache, MySQL
and other open source components, we came across a SourceForge open source
project initiated by SugarCRM, having the same vision, and doing something
very similar to what we were doing. They started out with the same promise
we did, namely that CRM software is needlessly expensive, and hosted offerings
only pretend to be affordable. While we were getting ready with our offering,
the open source project had already launched it; the underlying infrastructure
of Apache and MySQL was similar to what we were doing, and most importantly,
the SugarCRM Public License allowed us to create distributions based on this
code (SPL - a copy of Version 1.1.2 is found here, and the URL is at
http://www.sugarcrm.com/home/content/view/35/86/) we decided it would be even
faster to adopt that as our core and add value on top, an example of open
source based collaboration.

We gratefully acknowledge the contribution made by SugarCRM, and we intend to
actively participate and lead in bringing this vision of affordable enterprise
applications, but we make it clear that vtiger is not affiliated with nor is
endorsed by SugarCRM.

Please feel free to send your valuable comments to contact@vtiger.com so that
we can have a better CRM product at free of cost. Check out our website at
