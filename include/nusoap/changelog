                                 the following...
> Changes for the multiple/nested imports from the wsdl file. This builds an
> array of files not just the last one and also checks for relative paths to
> the parent. This will then get the imported files from the remote site
> instead of your local disk. Local wsdl files should still work (untested).
>
> Changes for multiple encoding sytles as previously posted
