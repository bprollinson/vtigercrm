<h1>vtiger CRM 5 Alpha - Security Management Implementation</h1>
<P>Date: January 16, 2006
<P>The following functions are incorporated in the vtiger CRM 5 Alpha Security 
  Management implementation:
<P>1. The Role is based on Organization Hierarchy.
<P>2. The Roles can have one-to-multiple profiles.
<P>3. Each User is associated with a role, which in turn associated with the profiles.
<P>4. Profiles specify the access for various actions in each of the modules.
<P>5. Group Support- Group can consists of:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Groups</li>
  <li>Roles</li>
  <li>Roles &amp; Subordinates</li>
  <li> Users</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> In vtiger CRM 5.0 Alpha group level security has been implemented 
  only for the Leads, Tickets, FAQ, and Activities modules.</p>
<p><b>6.&nbsp; Profiles override the Sharing Rules i.e. the Profile is the master:</b></p>
<p>For example, one of the users has sharing privilege to view others accounts. 
  But his profile does not allow him to view accounts. In this case,&nbsp; the 
  user cannot view the accounts.<br>
  <br>
  <b>7. Default Organization Sharing Access:</b></p>
<p>Your organization's 
  sharing model sets the default access that users have to each other's data. 
  The default sharing access levels are listed below.&nbsp; </p>

        calendar sharing.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> When Account is Private, the Related Potential, Ticket, Quote, 
  Sales Order, Purchase Order, and Invoice access is also set to private in Default 
  Organization Sharing model. </p>
<p><b>8.&nbsp; Sharing Rules Specification by Administrator:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Apart from the Default Organization Sharing Access, the administrator&nbsp; 
    can also create Organization Level Sharing Rules for the following modules 
    to share the data between Roles, Roles&amp;Subordinates and Groups : 
    <ul>
      <li>Leads</li>
      <li> Accounts/Contacts</li>
      <li> Potentials</li>
      <li>Emails</li>
      <li>HelpDesk</li>
      <li>Quotes</li>
      <li>SalesOrder</li>
      <li>Purchase Order</li>
      <li>Invoices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sharing Rules can only extend the visibility and cannot hide the visibility&nbsp; 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>On creating the Sharing Rules, Access for the Related modules can also be 
    specified.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Sharing Rules are created to share data between Roles, Roles&amp;Subordinates 
    and Groups</li>
</ul>
<p><b> Notes on Data Sharing:</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regardless of the organization-wide defaults, users can always view and 
    edit all data owned by or shared with users below them in the role hierarchy.</li>
  <li>While your sharing model controls visibility to records, user permissions 
    control what users can do to the records that are visible to them. For example, 
    if you share an account with other users, those users can only see the account 
    if they have the "Read" permission on accounts. Likewise, users who have the 
    "Edit" permission on contacts may still not be able to edit contacts they 
    do not own if they are working in a Private sharing model.</li>
  <li>Administrators, and users with the "View All Data" or "Edit All Data" permissions, 
    have access to view or edit all data.</li>
  <li>Only Administrators have access to configure the Access Privileges &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li>You must have at least read access to a record to be able to add activities 
    or other associated records to it (for example associated products)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b></p>
<p><b>The new security management support is provided for the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Home Page, Custom View, Reports, Dashboard, Activity History, and Calendar.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Delete Handling of Roles, Groups is not fully functional.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Editing of Groups will not function properly.<br>
  </li>
  <li> In ListView, Related List View, Popup List View &amp; Search List View 
    Sharing Rules for Related Modules are not implemented.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Tab hiding in header is not implemented.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Group Level Security support is implemented only for the Leads, Activities 
    and Tickets modules.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Parent Type Security Handling is not implemented for the Products and Notes 
    modules. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Read Only Support in field level security is not implemented.</li>
</ul>
