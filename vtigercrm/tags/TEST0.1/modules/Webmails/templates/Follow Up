Dear

Thank you for extending us the opportunity to meet with
you and members of your staff.

I know that John Doe serviced your account
for many years and made many friends at your firm. He has personally
discussed with me the deep relationship that he had with your firm.
While his presence will be missed, I can promise that we will
continue to provide the fine service that was accorded by
John to your firm.

I was genuinely touched to receive such fine hospitality.

Thank you once again.

Sincerely,
